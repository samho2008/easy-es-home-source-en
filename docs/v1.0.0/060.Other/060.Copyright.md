In order to maintain the syntax consistent with MP, some codes of this framework are derived from the open source framework [Mybatis-Plus](https://mp.baomidou.com/), or have been modified, which are specially declared here.

The bottom layer of this framework uses the ElasticSearch official open source framework [RestHighLevelClient](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/index.html), which is specially declared here.

This framework adopts the same [Apache2.0 open source protocol](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) as Mybatis-plus, and promises never to participate in commercial use, only for free use.
