// Get the query parameters generated by this framework, which can be used to check whether the query parameters generated by this framework are correct and for other purposes
String getSource(LambdaEsQueryWrapper<T> wrapper);

:::tip Tips
If you get DSL statements just for printing, you donâ€™t need to manually call this interface to get DSL statements. The DSL statements will be printed on the console by default. If you need to close the production environment, please configure print-dsl=false in the configuration file. For the configuration, please refer to Configuration chapter.
