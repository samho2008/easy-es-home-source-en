:::tip Tips
In some high-level grammars, such as specifying a highlighted field, if our return type is the entity object itself, but there is usually no highlighted field in the entity, so the highlighted field cannot be received. In this case, the native return object SearchResponse of RestClietn can be used.
Although EE covers most of the scenarios in which we use ES, there may still be scenarios that are not covered. At this time, you can still query through the native syntax provided by RestClient, just call the standard native query method. The input parameters and returns are both RestClient native
If you need to use RestHighLevelClient in your code, you can directly use @Autowired annotation injection, EE has automatically configured the bean for you, so the use of EE is always >=RestHighLevelClient.
